Un-forked from the original because it had diverged too much.  This version is meant for generating training data for TensorFlow, Caffe, etc from 3D models.

Based on https://github.com/acgessler/open3mod :
# Open 3D Model Viewer 

A general-purpose 3D model viewer. Based on 
[Open Asset Import Library](https://github.com/assimp/assimp), it supports 
reading about __fourty 3D file formats__, including __FBX, DXF, Collada, Obj, X, PLY, 3DS, LWO, LWS, STL__ 
and  __IFC__ ([full list](http://assimp.sourceforge.net/main_features_formats.html)).
